# LSDC-morph

This dataset contains PoS tagged and morphologically annotated data in Low Saxon dialects from several centuries mostly covering the modern period starting from 1650. It will continuously be updated as the annotation progresses. In our annotation, we follow the CoNLL-U format. 

## Content

So far, this dataset contains sentences from four German Low Saxon dialects: German North Saxon (Holsatian / Holstein dialect (HOL)), Marchian / Brandenburgish (MAR), Mecklenburgish - West Pomeranian (MKB) and Eastphalian (OFL). These are represented by 50 sentences each, except for the Eastphalian part which contains 66 sentences on the whole since sentences 5–20 are lines from a poem. 
More dialects will be added in future releases.
