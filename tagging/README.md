# LSDC-morph

This dataset contains PoS tagged and morphologically annotated data in Low Saxon dialects from two time periods: 1800-1939 and 1980-2022. Around 900 sentences were annoated manually, the remainder automatically, with an accuary of 92% for PoS tags and 83% for morphological features based on a held-out testset. In our annotation, we follow the CoNLL-U format. 

## Content

This dataset contains sentences from eight Low Saxon dialects: Dutch North Saxon (NNS), German North Saxon (DNS), Dutch Westphalian (NWF), German Westphalian (DWF), Eastphalian (OFL), Marchian / Brandenburgish (BRA), Mecklenburgish - West Pomeranian (MVP) and Low Prussian (NPR).

    abstract = "We compare five Low Saxon dialects from the 19th and 21st century from Germany and the Netherlands with each other as well as with modern Standard Dutch and Standard German. Our comparison is based on character n-grams on the one hand and PoS n-grams on the other and we show that these two lead to different distances. Particularly in the PoS-based distances, one can observe all of the 21st century Low Saxon dialects shifting towards the modern majority languages.",
